/*
Write a program that can return the sum of digits from a  string
             Ex:
                 input: A1B2C3

                 output:    6

             Hint: You need to get each of the character by using a loop
	             	To convert char to number:
						             	   '0' - 48   ==> 0
						             	   '1' - 48   ==> 1
