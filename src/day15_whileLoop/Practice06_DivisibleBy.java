/*
Create a class named DivisibleBy and Write a program that can print
the numbers between 1 ~ N that can be divisible by 3, 5, and 15.
                    if the number can be divisible by 3, 5 and 15,
                        then it should only be displayed in
DivisibelBy15' section
                    if the number can be divisible by 3 but cannot be
divisible by 15,
DivisibelBy3' section
then it should only be displayed in
divisible by 15,
DivisibelBy5' section
if the number can be divisible by 5 but cannot be
    then it should only be displayed in
